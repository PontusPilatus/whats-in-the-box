# Block Party

A fun interactive application where colorful squares dance in a spiral pattern. Built with React for the frontend and .NET/C# for the backend.

## Features

- Add colorful squares with a click
- Watch them arrange in a spiral pattern
- Hover effects for interaction
- Disco mode (unlocks after 25 squares)
- Persistence via backend API
- Offline mode support - works even without backend connection

## Tech Stack

### Frontend
- React with TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- Modern React hooks and patterns
- Graceful degradation for offline use

### Backend
- .NET 8.0 / C# Web API
- File-based persistence using JSON
- RESTful API design

## Running the Application

### Prerequisites
- Node.js and npm for the frontend
- .NET 8.0 SDK for the backend

### Backend Setup
1. Navigate to the backend directory:
   ```
   cd backend
   ```
2. Create the data directory:
   ```
   mkdir -p Data
   ```
3. Run the .NET API:
   ```
   dotnet run
   ```
4. The API will be available at https://localhost:7107

### Frontend Setup
1. Navigate to the frontend directory:
   ```
   cd frontend
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```
3. Start the development server:
   ```
   npm start
   ```
4. The application will be available at http://localhost:3000

## How It Works

- When you click "BOOM! New Block", a new square with a random color is created
- The square's position and color are sent to the backend API for storage
- When the page is refreshed, the application retrieves the previously saved state
- Squares are arranged in a spiral pattern, calculated based on their position in the sequence
- After adding 25 squares, you unlock disco mode, which makes the squares flash with different colors
- If the backend is unavailable, the app will switch to offline mode and continue to function

## Project Structure

- `/frontend` - React frontend application
- `/backend` - .NET/C# backend API
